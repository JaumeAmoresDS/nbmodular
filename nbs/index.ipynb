However, even if a new variable with the same name is defined inside the cell, the resulting function is still correct.\n",

    "        - Comparing variable values before and after cell:\n",
    "            - Good for small variables where doing a deep copy is not computationally expensive.\n",
    "        - Using type checker:\n",
